# Project Name

The assingment is to buid a bot and practice DOM manupilation and building functions.

## The problem

I started to plan my questions from the bot and then i built the question one by one and added buttons so the user could make some choices. I had a lot of problems with getting the buttons to work correctly, used AI as a mentor to guide me thru trouble shooting.
